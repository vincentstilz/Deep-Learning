# Customer Churn Prediction with Neural Networks

This repository contains a Python script (`NeuralNetworkChurnPred.py`) for predicting customer churn using a neural network model. The script employs a machine learning approach to identify customers who are likely to churn, which can be useful for businesses looking to improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset required for running this script is not included in this repository due to its size or privacy concerns. Users are encouraged to use their own customer dataset or any relevant dataset available online that includes customer features like demographics, service usage, billing information, and churn status.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install several Python libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and pandas. 

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Ensure you have a dataset that is compatible with the expectations of the script.

### Usage
To execute the script and start predicting customer churn:

python NeuralNetworkChurnPred.py

Follow any on-screen prompts or configure the script to handle input and output paths as needed.

### Contributing

Contributions to enhance or extend the functionality of this churn prediction script are welcome. This can include improving the neural network model, adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving the documentation.

Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
